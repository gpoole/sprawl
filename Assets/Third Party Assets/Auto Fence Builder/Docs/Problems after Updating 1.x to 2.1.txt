As per the Release Notes, any ‘live’ fences should have been ‘Finished’ before updating, and the instance of Auto Fence Builder in the Hierarchy should be removed and re-added after updating. 

Backing up is essential when updating & importing  assets that are heavily script/editor driven as Unity can change some of the meta files, resulting in broken links and possibly different inspector settings.

If you accidentally over-wrote a live fence in-progress…


If you backed up your project before updating, the easiest thing to do is use the backup project and ‘Finish’ any live fences, then remove AFB from the Hierarchy, then import the AFB v2 update and add to your scene.

If you didn’t backup:

You’ll notice that Unity probably removed the script from Auto Fencer Builder in the Hierarchy (meta file changes), if so, re-add AutoFenceCreator.cs to Auto Fence Builder. You should now see the fence you were working on before the update. 

Note:  You will NOT see the new v2 presets if you’ve imported v2 and merged into an old v1.x scene.
Again, finish the fence in progress, remove AFB from the Hierarchy, the re-add AFB.

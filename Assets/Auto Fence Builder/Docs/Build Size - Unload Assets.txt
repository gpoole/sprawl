Reducing Build Size to Minimum


After Finishing your walls and fences, it's a good idea to remove all unused fence & wall assets to reduce build size.
Scroll to the bottom of the AFWB Inspector and select : Unload Assets[Optimize Build Size]

This will close AFWB to an unloaded state, and provide a button to reload it when you've finished your Build. (It can also be reloaded by reselecting AFWB in the hierarchy, or shift-clicking in the Scene.)

Make sure AFWB is in the unloaded state when you build.

Note: You can also remove AFWB from the Hierarchy to clear the resources, but Unloading is more convenient when testing and iterating.
